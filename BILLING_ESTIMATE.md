## Recommended Billing

### Hourly Approach
- **Conservative:** 40 hours × £40 = **£1,600**
- **Realistic:** 50 hours × £40 = **£2,000**
- **Comprehensive:** 55 hours × £40 = **£2,200**

### Recommended Total
**45-50 hours × £40/hour = £1,800-£2,000**

This covers:
- Requirements gathering and planning
- AI-assisted development (prompting, reviewing, iterating)
- Testing and debugging
- Integration setup (Google Calendar, WhatsApp, Supabase)
- Deployment and configuration
- Documentation
- Iterations and refinements

### Alternative: Fixed Fee
Given the scope and established rate, a **fixed fee of £1,800-£2,000** is reasonable. This:
- Simplifies billing
- Reflects the value delivered
- Accounts for iterations and refinements
- Maintains the friendship-friendly rate

---

## Notes

- **Most code was AI-generated** - human time focused on guidance, testing, configuration, and refinement rather than writing code from scratch
- **Value delivered is significant** - full-stack application with complex integrations
- **Rate reflects friendship discount** - standard market rate would be £50-100/hour
- **Fixed fee recommended** - simplifies billing and accounts for all iterations

---

## Final Recommendation

**Billing:** 45-50 hours at £40/hour = **£1,800-£2,000**  
**OR**  
**Fixed Fee:** **£1,800-£2,000**

Both approaches are fair and reflect the established working relationship.
